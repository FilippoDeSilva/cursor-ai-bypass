## Overview

This Python toolkit automates several tasks for Cursor and Windsurf AI, including:

- Bypassing telemetry and version checks by manipulating key files (`storage.json`, product version, machine ID, etc.).
- Registering new Cursor accounts using temporary/disposable email services (Temp-Mail-Plus).
- Resetting machine identifiers and cleaning up telemetry data.
- Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Features

- **Telemetry Bypass**: Randomizes telemetry IDs in `storage.json` for Cursor and Windsurf AI.
- **Version Bypass**: Modifies version information to bypass version checks.
- **Automated Registration**: Registers new Cursor accounts using headless browser automation and disposable email.
- **Cross-Platform**: Detects OS and adapts file paths as needed.
- **Safe Backups**: Backs up key files before modification.
- **Configurable**: Uses a YAML/JSON config file for paths, credentials, and options.
- **Colorful CLI**: Uses `pyfiglet` for ASCII art and `colorama` for colored output.
