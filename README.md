# Cursor AI Telemetry Modifier

### Disclaimer:

This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes or for modifying telemetry data in environments you have the right to access and modify. Misuse of this tool on unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical. **The author is not responsible for the misuse of this tool. Use it at your own discretion and responsibility.**

---

## Description

The Cursor AI Telemetry Modifier is a Python-based script that anonymizes telemetry data by replacing existing identifiers with random UUID-based values. It is designed to modify the `storage.json` file for Cursor AI in a user-friendly and privacy-conscious manner.

---

## Features

- **Telemetry Anonymization**: Replaces telemetry-related fields with randomly generated UUID-based values.
- **ASCII Art Header**: Displays "CURSOR AI" in ASCII art for an enhanced user experience.
- **JSON File Handling**: Reads, modifies, and saves JSON data with comprehensive error handling.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear and actionable messages for every operation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure the following:

1. **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Required Python libraries are installed:
   - `pyfiglet`: Install using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pyfiglet
     ```
   - Built-in libraries `json` and `uuid`.

---

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. Open the script file and update the `json_file_path` variable with the full path to your `storage.json` file:
   ```python
   json_file_path = r'C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Roaming\\Cursor\\User\\globalStorage\\storage.json'
Run the script in your terminal:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
python cursor_ai_telemetry_modifier.py
The script will:

Generate and display ASCII art for "CURSOR AI".
Replace telemetry-related fields in the JSON file with random UUID values.
Save the updated data back to the JSON file and display a success message.
Error Handling
The script includes error handling for the following scenarios:

File Not Found: Displays an error message if the specified storage.json file is missing.
Invalid JSON: Notifies the user if the JSON file content cannot be decoded due to formatting issues.
